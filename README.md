## Description

**BvsN** is a web-based wargame inspired by old-school browser games. Designed for strategic gameplay, BvsN combines a classic hexagonal map grid with limited actions per turn, where players must carefully plan their moves and manage resources to gain an advantage. This game leverages modern web technologies for a seamless and dynamic experience while retaining the nostalgic feel of classic navigator-based wargames.

Players choose factions, deploy units, and engage in turn-based combat on a dynamic map, each decision affecting the course of the game. The initial setup uses **Next.js** for the client-side interface, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a quick and responsive design. The backend is planned to be developed in **Node.js**, ensuring scalable and real-time interactions between players.

More features, technologies, and gameplay elements will be added as the project progresses.
